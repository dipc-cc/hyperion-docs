# Data transfer

One of the most common applications for securely transferring data between two hosts are Secure Copy (SCP) and Secure FTP (SFTP).

To transfer files into or out of HPC systems using SCP or SFTP, you need a SSH client:

- GNU/Linux: command ssh, scp or sftp or a GUI tool like GFTP.
- Windows: GUI tools such as WinSCP,
- macOS: Command-line tools ssh, scp or sftp or a GUI tool like FileZilla.
