# Storage and Filesystem overview

## Storage System Usage 

#### [Home](home/index.md)
Your home directory is where you arrive by default when you login to the cluster or any access/login node. It is mounted on `/dipc/username`. Configuration files are stored here: `.bash_profile`, `.tcshrc`, `.vimrc`, etc. 

#### [scratch](scratch/index.md)
`/scratch` is a shared high performance storage that system provides access to large amounts of disk. It meant to be used as the work space for jobs.

#### [Long term storage](long_storage_index.md)
A filesystem designed for permanent data storage. 

!!! note "Storage increase"
    Although the storage capacity of `/scratch` should be large enough, if more is needed, contact us and we will assess the storage increase.
