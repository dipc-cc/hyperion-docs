# Accounts

## Obtainin a user account

In order to use Hyperion facilities, you need:

1. A user account with an associated user login name (also called a username).
2. You belong to a Basque university or institution.
3. Access to a project with an allocation of computational or storage resources.


### How to get a New User account

If you don't possess a user account, you are encouraged to apply for an account.

Please fill out the necessary form:

- [Hyperion account form](dipc_account_form.pdf).

Once completed, submit it either personally to our HPC Resource Manager or send it via email to <support-cc@dipc.org>.

We kindly remind you that the approval of account requests is not automatic and is subject to our internal review process.

## Passwords

A user is given a username (also known as a login name) and associated password that permits that user to access Hyperion. This username/password pair may be used by a single individual only: _passwords must not be shared with any other person._

Passwords must be changed as soon as possible after exposure or suspected compromise. Exposure of passwords and suspected compromises must immediately be reported to the support team. 

### Modifying Your Password

After your account is successfully created, a temporary password will be issued to you. For enhanced security and personalization, it is advisable to change this password at the earliest opportunity.

To modify your password, simply execute the following command:

```
$ passwd 
```

Upon entering the command, you will be prompted to type in your existing password. Following that, you will be asked to provide your new password.

Please ensure that your new password complies with the following criteria:

- It must contain at least two uppercase characters.
- It must include at least two lowercase characters.
- It must have at least two digits.
- It must feature at least two special characters.
- It should be at least 8 characters in length.
- It should not be a repetition or overly similar to any of your previous passwords.

These rules are put in place to ensure the security of your account and protect the integrity of our computing resources. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.

### Forgotten passwords

If you have forgotten your password, do not worry, send an email to ![technical support](support-cc@dipc.org). You will be provided with a temporary password.
You will have to change this password when you reconnect to Hyperion and you will have to meet the requirements explained above.
